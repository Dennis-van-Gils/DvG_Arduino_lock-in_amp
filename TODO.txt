* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Investigate more numba.njit to speed up calculations

* Make docstrings conform my other modules (Google hybrid style). Among others,
  touch-up `dvg_fftw_convolver.py` and `dvg_ringbuffered_fir_filter.py`

* Turn `dvg_fftw_convolver`, `dvg_ringbuffer_fir_filter` and
  `dvg_fftw_welchpowerspectrum.py` into new PyPi package called
  `dvg-signal-processing`
  
* Refactor `Alia_qdev` and co.: buffers should be called blocks and deque should
  be called ring buffer
  
* See `timeit_np_ufunc_more.py` and observe that param `out` speeds up
  calculations when using numpy.ufuncs like `np.multiply()` and `np.add()`

* `Arduino_protocol_serial.listen_to_lockin_amp()` can be sped up by numpy ufuncs.
