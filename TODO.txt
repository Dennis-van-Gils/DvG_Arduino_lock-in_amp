PYTHON


* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Turn `dvg_fftw_convolver`, `dvg_ringbuffer_fir_filter` and
  `dvg_fftw_welchpowerspectrum.py` into new PyPi package called
  `dvg-signal-processing`

* For the SSD practicum a less steep filter is asked for --> Reduce `N_blocks`,
  hence reducing `N_taps` ==> set N_blocks to 3.
  Also, do not automatically adjust the mixer cut-off frequency to (2*f - 5) Hz,
  but let the students figure out the 3dB point themselves
  
* Mixer is in units of V^2

* Hide the AC coupling control on the mixer filter
