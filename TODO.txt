* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Investigate more numba.njit to speed up calculations

* Make docstrings conform my other modules (Google hybrid style). Among others,
  touch-up `dvg_fftw_convolver.py` and `dvg_ringbuffered_fir_filter.py`
  
* Turn `dvg_fftw_convolver`, `dvg_ringbuffer_fir_filter` and
  `dvg_fftw_welchpowerspectrum.py` into new PyPi package called
  `dvg-signal-processing`
  
* LED status light does not indicate filter has settled, instead it indicates
  that there is valid filter output present. Perhaps explain that with settle we
  actually mean the above.
