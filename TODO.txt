* Timer roll-over

  Handle Arduino timer roll-over at t = 4294967295 us correctly. Current Python
  code will think there are dropped samples at timer roll-over. Happens every
  71.2 minutes.

* Add min, max, avg, std textfields to tab `Mixer` for signal `filt_I`

* Rethink `write_data_to_log()` because writing data line for line is slow.
Try writing a complete block of lines instead.

* Requesting and retrieving Arduino settings should print to the console as one
block instead of two
