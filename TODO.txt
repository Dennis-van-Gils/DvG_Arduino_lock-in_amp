PYTHON


* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Investigate more numba.njit to speed up calculations

* Turn `dvg_fftw_convolver`, `dvg_ringbuffer_fir_filter` and
  `dvg_fftw_welchpowerspectrum.py` into new PyPi package called
  `dvg-signal-processing`
  
* See `timeit_np_ufunc_more.py` and observe that param `out` speeds up
  calculations when using numpy.ufuncs like `np.multiply()` and `np.add()`

* For the SSD practicum a less steep filter is asked for --> Reduce `N_blocks`,
  hence reducing `N_taps`.
  
* Check for the alpha-version hardware firmware (i.e. the current
  `SSD practicum` firmware) and notify the user to flash to the
  latest firmware first in order to continue the main Python program.


FIRMWARE


* Perhaps implement an auto-calibration routine by routing DAC to ADC
  internally, i.e. via the chipset itself not via a physical wire.
