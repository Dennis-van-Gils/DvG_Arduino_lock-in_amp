PYTHON


* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Turn `dvg_fftw_convolver`, `dvg_ringbuffer_fir_filter` and
  `dvg_fftw_welchpowerspectrum.py` into new PyPi package called
  `dvg-signal-processing`

* For the SSD practicum a less steep filter is asked for --> Reduce `N_blocks`,
  hence reducing `N_taps`.
