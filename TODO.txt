* Timer roll-over

Handle Arduino timer roll-over at t = 4294967295 us correctly. Current Python
code will think there are dropped samples at timer roll-over. Happens every
71.2 minutes.

* Investigate why setting `debug = True` causes lock up when unpausing DAQ.

I expect it has to do with setting or reading the worker_DAQ._paused flag from
out of another thread. Perhaps change to make use of pyqtSignal
'signal_DAQ_paused'.
