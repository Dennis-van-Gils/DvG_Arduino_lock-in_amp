* Timer roll-over

  Handle Arduino timer roll-over at t = 4294967295 us correctly. Current Python
  code will think there are dropped samples at timer roll-over. Happens every
  71.2 minutes.

  The SAMD51 M4 board reports time in microseconds, based on SYSTICK, as 32
  bits, hence the rollover is 2^32 = 4294967295 us = 71.2 minutes. This can't be
  improved easily on the microcontroller.
  
  We should work around this on the Python side, which can handle 64 bits. 
  
  In addition: make t_0 start at 0 seconds in the log.

* Add min, max, avg, std textfields to tab `Mixer` for signal `filt_I`

* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file
