* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Investigate more numba.njit to speed up calculations

* Turn `dvg_fftw_convolver`, `dvg_ringbuffer_fir_filter` and
  `dvg_fftw_welchpowerspectrum.py` into new PyPi package called
  `dvg-signal-processing`
  
* See `timeit_np_ufunc_more.py` and observe that param `out` speeds up
  calculations when using numpy.ufuncs like `np.multiply()` and `np.add()`

* `Arduino_protocol_serial.listen_to_lockin_amp()` can be sped up by numpy ufuncs.
