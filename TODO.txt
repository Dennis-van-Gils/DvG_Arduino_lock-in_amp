* Timer roll-over

  Handle Arduino timer roll-over at t = 4294967295 us correctly. Current Python
  code will think there are dropped samples at timer roll-over. Happens every
  71.2 minutes.
  https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/12587/how-can-i-handle-the-millis-rollover

* Add min, max, avg, std textfields to tab `Mixer` for signal `filt_I`

* Requesting and retrieving Arduino settings should print to the console as one
block instead of two

* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Make t_0 start at 0 seconds in the log.
The best solution might be to change the firmware on the Arduino to start the
time at t = 0 when having received 'lock_in.start()'. We subtract the internal
Arduino time with a newly set `t_start`, which might also fix the timer
roll-over problem.
