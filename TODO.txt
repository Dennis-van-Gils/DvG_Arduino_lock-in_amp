OVERALL

* Add a changelog with the following:
    - Upgraded from 5 kHz to 25 kHz sampling rate
    - Fixed mistake in calculating R
    - V_rms as unit for the amplitude, instead of V
    - Single-ended ADC, instead of differential
    - Added square and triangular waveforms
    - Timer roll-over is increased from 71 minutes to 49 days
    - Many other stability and speed improvements on the Python side
    - Fixed Python package versions to ensure identical environments across computers


PYTHON


* Add support for HDF5 to allow writing log as binary file

* Turn `dvg_fftw_convolver`, `dvg_ringbuffer_fir_filter` and
  `dvg_fftw_welchpowerspectrum.py` into new PyPi package called
  `dvg-signal-processing`

* For the SSD practicum a less steep filter is asked for --> Reduce `N_blocks`,
  hence reducing `N_taps` ==> set N_blocks to 3.
  Also, do not automatically adjust the mixer cut-off frequency to (2*f - 5) Hz,
  but let the students figure out the 3dB point themselves
