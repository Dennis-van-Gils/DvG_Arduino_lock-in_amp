CONCLUSION

Ditch the use of deque, but use a numpy buffer instead.
I.e.
  Not: signal.fftconvolve(collections.deque           , numpy.ndarray[dtype=float64])
  But: signal.fftconvolve(numpy.ndarray[dtype=float64], numpy.ndarray[dtype=float64])
  
We don't need the thread-safe behavior and left-rigt appending possibilties of deque.
We only extend the buffers in method 'lockin_DAQ_update', which is mutex locked already.
Sticking to a numpy array is faster. That is because, when using deque, we spend time
transforming the deque into numpy array. This happens behind the scenes of scipy.
